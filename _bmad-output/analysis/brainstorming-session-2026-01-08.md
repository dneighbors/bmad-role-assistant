# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** derek  
**Date:** 2026-01-08  
**Session:** CTO Role Assistant Module

---

## Session Overview

**Topic:** CTO Role Assistant Module - A comprehensive AI assistant system for the CTO role, built as a shareable BMAD module

**Goals:**
1. Brainstorm a complete list of AGENTS for the CTO assistant
2. Brainstorm WORKFLOWS these agents would execute
3. Prepare for BMAD Builder questions (personas, communication styles, menus, etc.)

### Context Guidance

*Drawing from earlier proposal discussions about role-based AI assistants for the enterprise. Key concepts: agents with personas, workflows with step-file architecture, memory/sidecar patterns for persistence, MCP integrations for external tools.*

### Session Setup

**Starting Point Ideas (from proposal discussion):**
- **Agents sketched:** CTO Advisor, Executive Assistant, Meeting Prep, One-on-One, Email Composer, Research Analyst, Tech Review, Board Prep, Architecture Review
- **Workflows sketched:** prepare-1on1, weekly-review, tech-strategy, build-vs-buy
- **Memory needs:** 1:1 sidecars per person, decision logs, strategic priorities

**Session Focus:** Expand, refine, and detail these ideas - plus discover what we're missing!

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques  
**Analysis Context:** CTO Role Assistant Module with focus on comprehensive agent/workflow discovery and builder preparation

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Role Playing** (collaborative) - Generate agent ideas by embodying different stakeholder perspectives
2. **Morphological Analysis** (deep) - Systematically map agents to workflows, memory, integrations
3. **Question Storming** (deep) - Generate and pre-answer BMAD builder questions

**AI Rationale:** This sequence moves from divergent thinking (discover all possible agents) through systematic exploration (map each agent's dimensions) to practical preparation (ready for Morgan the builder). Perfect for creating a shareable BMAD module.
